## Problem 2: Find Products Sold on the Last Day of Each Month

### Objective
Given a table of sales data with product names and sale dates, identify all the products that were sold on the last day of each month.

### Input Table - `sales`:

| sale_id | product_name | sale_date |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 1       | Laptop       | 2024-01-31|

| 4       | Monitor      | 2024-02-28|
| 5       | Laptop       | 2024-03-31|

### Output:
The output should list the `sale_id`, `product_name`, and `sale_date` for the products sold on the last day of each month.

### Constraints
- The `sale_date` is in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- A month can have multiple products sold on the last day.

### Example
#### Input:
```plaintext
sale_id | product_name | sale_date
-----------------------------------
1       | Laptop       | 2024-01-31
2       | Mouse        | 2024-01-25
3       | Keyboard     | 2024-02-28
4       | Monitor      | 2024-02-28
5       | Laptop       | 2024-03-31
```

#### Output:
```plaintext
sale_id | product_name | sale_date

### Instructions
- Write a query to retrieve the sales records of products sold on the last day of each month.
- Ensure that the query correctly handles months with different numbers of days (e.g., February).
