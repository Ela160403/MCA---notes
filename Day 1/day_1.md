## Introduction to Arrays in Java üöÄ

#### Day 2 - 18-08-2024

#### **üìñ Concept of Arrays**

Arrays in Java are a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in a contiguous memory location. They allow you to store multiple values in a single variable, making data management more efficient. Arrays are fixed in size and can be accessed using an index.

#### **‚ú® Advantages of Arrays**

- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, leading to efficient data retrieval.
- **Ease of Access**: Elements can be accessed quickly using their index, making arrays ideal for scenarios requiring fast lookups.
- **Data Management**: Store and manage large volumes of data in a structured format.
- **Fixed Size**: Knowing the array size beforehand ensures better memory allocation and management.

#### **üåü Use Cases of Arrays**

- **Data Storage**: Store a list of elements, such as numbers or strings.
- **Matrix Operations**:  Represent matrices and perform mathematical operations on them.
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Implement and optimize algorithms for data sorting and searching.
- **Handling Multiple Variables**: Manage collections of similar data types, such as student grades or product prices.


#### **üõ†Ô∏è Implementing a Simple Array in Java**

Given an 0-indexed array of integers arr[] of size n, find its peak element and return it's index. An element is considered to be peak if it's value is greater than or equal to the values of its adjacent elements (if they exist).

```java

```
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

#### **‚ùì Array Questions to Practice**

1. **Print Even and Odd Elements from an Array**:

   - **Objective**: Print all even and odd elements separately from a given array.
   - **Key Concept**: Understanding array traversal and conditional operations.

2. **Reverse an Array**:

   - **Objective**: Reverse the elements in an array without using an additional array.
   - **Key Concept**: Grasping in-place array manipulation.

3. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays:**:
   - **Objective**: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
   - **Key Concept**: Mastering array merging and sorting techniques.
